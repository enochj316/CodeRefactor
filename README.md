# CodeRefactor
Homework Assignment

This was an assignment where a code was provided and clean up work was to be done. I've changed the tags to make it more "accessible" and cleaned the CSS code to compress it and simplify it. 
I started by changing the tags to HTML schematics to make it easily accessible by all readers and fixed any broken links. I also implemented "alt tags" for the images with descriptive captions for anyone who is visually impaired to make the site inclusive. I commented out all the coding to ensure anyone who reads the code can see which line is associated with which specific part of the website. I also fixed any broken tags and ensure the site was fully functional. 

For the CSS I consolidated the coding to remove any repetitive styling and thoroughly commented out each line to show specific association within the site. 
This was a very worthwhile exercise, given that it had to do with making the code user friendly and accessible. Given the era that we live in, there is no excuse that anybody finds any barriers online to access any content. As we strive to make our psychical world more accessible, there is no reason the digital world should not follow closely behind or even take the lead.
