# CodeRefactor
Homework Assignment

This was an assignment where a code was provided, and clean-up work was to be done. I have changed the tags to make it more "accessible". I have cleaned the CSS code to compress it and simplify it. 
I started by changing the tags to HTML schematics to make it easily accessible to all readers and I fixed any broken links. I also implemented "alt tags" for the images with descriptive captions for anyone who is visually impaired to make the site inclusive. I commented out all the coding to ensure anyone who reads the code can see which line is associated with each specific part of the website. I also fixed any broken tags to ensure the site was fully functional. 

For the CSS, I consolidated the coding to remove any repetitive styling and thoroughly commented out each line to show specific associations within the site.

This was a very worthwhile exercise, given that it had to do with making the code user-friendly and accessible. Given the era that we live in, there is no excuse for anybody finding online barriers in accessing content. Ensuring accessibility provides everyone with equal access to opportunities. As we strive to make our physical world more accessible, there is no reason the digital world should not follow closely behind or even take the lead.
